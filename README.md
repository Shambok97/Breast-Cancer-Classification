# Breast-Cancer-Classification using Machine Learning 

##Overview
 Breast Cancer has been a contributor to high number of deaths a year among women and it has also been classed as the most common type of cancer, based on extensive research. In the medical field, classification of data through data mining and artificial intelligence is an effective way for healthcare professionals to reach a diagnosis. Therefore, the current study aimed to put forward three supervised machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer based on the cell features in a data set available by the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning repository. The features represent the various characteristics of the cell nuclei which we have implemented through decision tree, random forest and the k-nearest neighbour algorithm (KNN) classifiers and compare their performances in their ability to accurately classify data. Our results suggest that the mean test accuracy of random forest is higher than the accuracy of KNN and Decision tree. We further propose our future directions based on the limitations we faced with the data set available and algorithms used.
